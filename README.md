üöÄ Bare Blockchain (PoS-Based)
üìå Project Overview
Bare Blockchain is a lightweight, decentralized blockchain application that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism instead of traditional energy-intensive mining. Built with Python (Flask) for the backend, Solidity (via Hardhat) for smart contracts, and React for the frontend, this project is ideal for learning, prototyping, and developing real-world decentralized applications (DApps).

‚ú® Key Features
Energy-Efficient PoS Consensus: Validators stake tokens to validate blocks rather than performing resource-intensive computations.
Native Token ‚Äì BareCoin: A built-in digital currency for transactions, staking rewards, and governance.
Secure Transactions: Utilizes RSA key pair generation, digital signatures, and secure transaction signing.
Smart Contract Integration: Dynamically deploy and execute smart contracts for automated processes and digital agreements.
Comprehensive REST API: Provides endpoints to submit transactions, mine blocks, manage nodes, deploy/execute contracts, and more.
Blockchain Explorer: A web interface to visualize blocks, transactions, and staking details in real time.
Persistent Storage & Cloud Backup: Uses SQLite to store blockchain data and periodically backs it up to Cloudinary.
AI-Powered Transaction Analysis: Detects anomalies in transactions using Isolation Forest from scikit-learn.
Modular & Extendable: Easily integrates new features like advanced governance, cross-chain support, and decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Smart Contracts: Solidity, Hardhat
Backend: Python, Flask, Web3.py, SQLite
Frontend: React.js (Create React App)
Blockchain Connectivity: Ethereum (via Alchemy for mainnet and Hardhat for local development)
Cloud Backup: Cloudinary
AI & Analytics: scikit-learn

üöÄ Running the Project Locally
1. Start the Local Blockchain (Hardhat)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd contracts
npx hardhat node
This command launches a local Ethereum network for testing your smart contracts.

2. Run the Backend (Flask API)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
python app.py
This starts the Flask server with REST API endpoints to interact with the blockchain.

3. Run the Frontend (React DApp)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend/blockchain-dapp
npm start
This opens the React development server in your browser.

üåé Deployment Instructions
üîπ Backend (Render Deployment)
Create an account at Render.
Connect your GitHub repository.
Configure deployment using a render.yaml file (placed in backend/config/):
yaml

    buildCommand: >
      apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential gcc libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev &&
      pip install --upgrade pip &&
      pip install -r config/requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
    envVars:
      - key: FLASK_ENV
        value: production
      - key: API_KEY
        value: "YOUR_API_KEY"

      - key: PORT
        value: "5000"
üîπ Smart Contracts (Alchemy & Hardhat)
Sign up at Alchemy and create a project to obtain your Alchemy API Key.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in app.py with your actual key:
python
Copy
Edit
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY'))
Deploy contracts (e.g., BareCoin and StakingGovernance):
bash
Copy
Edit
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
For local testing, you can deploy using:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat run scripts/deployBareCoin.js --network localhost
üîπ Frontend (Vercel / Netlify)
For Vercel:
In the frontend/blockchain-dapp folder, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
vercel
For Netlify:
Build and deploy using Netlify CLI:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
