🚀 Bare Blockchain (PoS-Based)
Bare Blockchain is a lightweight, functional blockchain implemented in Python using Flask. It provides decentralized transaction management, staking-based consensus (PoS), token creation, and smart contract execution.

Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, this blockchain uses Proof of Stake (PoS) for validation, making it energy-efficient and scalable.

🌟 Why Use Bare Blockchain?
✅ 1. Energy-Efficient PoS Consensus
Replaces PoW mining with staking-based validation.
No need for high-power mining rigs.
✅ 2. Fully Functional Blockchain
Transactions & staking-based validation instead of mining.
Validators stake tokens to validate blocks.
Smart contract support for automation & digital agreements.
✅ 3. Ideal for Learning & Prototyping
Understand PoS without Ethereum or complex setups.
Quickly prototype decentralized applications (DApps).
🎯 Features
🔗 Blockchain Features
✅ Secure transaction management.
✅ PoS-based validation (No mining required).
✅ Longest chain rule for resolving conflicts.
✅ REST API endpoints for seamless interaction.

🔐 Security & Cryptography
✅ RSA Key Pair Generation for secure transactions.
✅ Digital Signature Verification for transaction authenticity.
✅ Smart contract execution with custom logic evaluation.

💰 Token & Staking System
✅ Create custom tokens with unique symbols.
✅ Stake tokens to become a validator.
✅ Earn staking rewards for validating blocks.

📜 Smart Contracts
✅ Deploy smart contracts dynamically.
✅ Execute conditions before contract completion.

💡 Benefits of PoS-Based Bare Blockchain
🔹 No Mining, Just Staking!
Validators stake tokens instead of solving complex puzzles.
Energy-efficient & scalable.
🔹 Faster & Cheaper Transactions
No expensive mining fees.
Blocks are validated faster than PoW chains.
🔹 Real-World Blockchain Experience
Transactions, staking, smart contracts, and consensus.
🔹 Expandable & Customizable
Modify staking rewards and validator selection rules.
